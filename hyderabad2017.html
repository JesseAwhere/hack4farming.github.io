               <h3>About this Hackathon</h3>
			<p> The annual ICT4D Conference brings together public, private, and civil society organizations from across 
				the humanitarian and international development community to share how they’ve used technology to 
				increase the impact of their work. The 2017 conference in Hyderabad will focus on harnessing the power 
				of data to accelerate progress toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Yet persistent 
				challenges remain in connecting disparate existing datasets and overcoming the tendency of development 
				organizations to work on isolated projects and initiatives. </p>

			<p> In the ICT4D Data Jam, conference participants as well as interested technologists from the Hyderabad area will put 
				data to work, brainstorm ways that technology can serve civil society and development, and present their
				work before a panel of judges. </p>
		    
		    <p> The ICT4D Data Jam focuses primarily on agriculture and the environment, and datasets and APIs provided by DevHack 
			    will be agriculture and environment related. However, the event will welcome ideas that touch on any of the ICT4D 
			    <a href = "http://www.ict4dconference.org/agenda/full-agenda/">Conference Tracks</a>, as most are deeply intertwined 
			    with farmer welfare and environmental conservation.</p>
		    
		    <p> This hackathon is being sponsored by the <a href = "http://www.ict4dconference.org/">ICT4D Conference</a>,
			    <a href = "http://www.awhere.com/"> aWhere, Inc.</a>, the 
			    <a href = "http://www.icrisat.org/">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics 
				(ICRISAT) - India</a>, and <a href = "http://globaldevelopmentanalytics.org/"> Global Development 
			    Analytics</a>.
			<br><br>
          <!-- Details TBD -->
			</p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            	<p> Challenge will be announced soon.</p>
            
            <h3>Schedule</h3>
		    <p> This event is scheduled to take place from <b>Friday, May 12, 2017 to Saturday, May 13, 2017</b>.  
			    It will be an all-day event on each day.  More details to follow and schedule is subject to change. </p>
