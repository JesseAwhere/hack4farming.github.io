               <h3>About this Hackathon</h3>
			<p> This hackathon is being sponsored by Microsoft India in partnership with the <a href = "http://www.icrisat.org/">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) - India</a>, <a href = "http://www.t-hub.co/">T-Hub</a> and aWhere, Inc.
			<br><br>

			In order to make the best decisions possible in a changing climate, farmers and agricultural value chain actors need access to comprehensive information about forecasted weather, ideal dates for planting and interventions, seed varieties, and potential return on investment. But this information is often difficult to compile and communicate in insightful ways.
			<br><br>

			To address these challenges, Hack4Farming Hyderabad will focus on weather, systems modeling, and their potential impacts on the Indian agriculture sector. Hackathon teams will explore how to leverage new modeling techniques (from ICRISAT researchers), weather data (from aWhere) and Intelligent Cloud (from Microsoft) to address these information gaps, and in so doing benefit agriculture stakeholders such as seed producers, service providers, and farmers across India.
			</p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            	<p>As the climate becomes more volatile, it is more difficult for Indian agriculture practitioners to make the right decisions about farm and value chain management, operations and risk assessment. Decisions made without the benefit of timely and targeted information in turn increase the vulnerability of farmers and Indian food security to today’s less predictable weather events.
		
		<br><br>Using the expert knowledge available in your team and available tools/datasets, design a solution that can address at least one informational gap in Indian agriculture. This solution should identify the information gap, provide a prototype or proof of concept for the solution, and address the sustainability of the solution through a business plan, proposal outline, or other mechanism.</p>
